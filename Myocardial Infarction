Overview: 

Myocardial infarction is a synonym for a heart attack. It is a condition where blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked leading the heart to stop. 
There are many factors that can contribute to the development of this condition. Through this analysis, we will try to gain insight about these factors 
and try to acknowledge them  to be able to define and quantify the risk of MI. 

Dataset: 

Our dataset includes information about different clinical and non clinical factors. We aim by analyzing relationships between factors to give insights
and predictions to have more control and awareness about this medical condition. 

Objectives:  

-Explore data and correlation between different factors. 
-Provide data to professionals to be able to develop tools for prediction of MI. 
-Provide awareness to communities and to the public about MI . 
-Encourage different populations to improve their lifestyles. 
-Include suggestions and recommendations.

1- Start to explore data : Reading the dataset 

SELECT* 
FROM bit_db.heart 
LIMIT 5 

#Dataset Frame:  
There are 303 rows and 14 columns. 

#Check for nulls: 

SELECT* 
FROM  bit_db.heart 
WHERE age is NULL AND sex is null and cp is null and trtbps is null and chol is null and fbs is null and restecg is null 
and thalachh is null and exng is null and oldpeak is null and slp is null and caa is null and thall is null and output is null; 

 #Checking for duplicates:

SELECT  age, chol, trtbps, count(*) as count 
FROM bit_db.heart 
GROUP BY  age, chol, trtbps 
HAVING  count (*)>1; 

2- ANALYSIS: 

#Calculate the average age :  

SELECT  avg (age) 
FROM  bit_db.heart 

#Determine the proportion of sex :  

SELECT count (sex), sex  
FROM bit_db.heart 
GROUP BY  sex 

> 96 of our population are women vs 206 are men. Therefore , men are more than twice as much as women. 

# What is the breakdown of the number of people having different levels of chest pain ? 

SELECT count (*) , cp 
FROM  bit_db.heart 
GROUP BY cp 

> Almost 48 % of  people experience  a typical angina related to MI. 45% experience non typical angina pain to non anginal pain. Only 7% are asymptomatic. 

#what is the breakdown of the resting ecg among the database? 

SELECT count(*), restecg 
FROM  bit_db.heart 
GROUP BY  restecg 

> 152 people have their ecg showing some ST abnormality, while 147 have normal ecg findings. 2 only are showing left ventricular infarction. 

# How many people are having asymptomatic chest pain and  ecg is showing left ventricular infarction ? 

SELECT cp , restecg , count(*) 
FROM bit_db.heart 
WHERE cp = "3" and restecg= "2" 

> There is absolutely no one showing no chest pain symptoms and a definite left ventricular hypertrophy. 

# How many people are having typical pain and an ecg showing  ST abnormalities ? 

SELECT cp , restecg , count(*)				 
FROM bit_db.heart 
WHERE cp = "0" and restecg= "1" 

> 62 people will experience typical chest pain and their ecg will show an ST abnormality. 
While only 3 will experience a typical chest and and ecg showing an infarction. 

# How many people are older than 45 years old and showing an ecg with ST abnormalities ? 

SELECT distinct * 
FROM bit_db.heart 
WHERE age >="45" AND restecg = "1" 
ORDER BY age ASC 

> 114 people are more than 45 years old and having their ecg showing a ST abnormality. 

#How many people less than 45 showing an abnormal ecg with ST abnormalities?  

SELECT distinct * 
FROM bit_db.heart 
WHERE age < "45" AND restecg = "1" 
ORDER BY age ASC 

>  37 people only less than 45 years old are having an abnormal ecg.
There is high correlation between   age and myocardial infarction. 

# How many people have high cholesterol more than 197 mg/ dl showing an abnormal ecg ? 

SELECT distinct * 
FROM bit_db.heart 
WHERE chol > "197" AND restecg = "1" or restecg = "2" 
ORDER BY chol ASC 

> Almost 43% of people with high cholesterol show an abnormal ecg. 

# How many people have a high fasting blood sugar more than 120 and are experiencing an abnormal ecg ? 

SELECT distinct * 
FROM bit_db.heart 
WHERE fbs = "1" AND  restecg = "1"  
OR  restecg= "2" 

> 23 people with a fasting blood sugar more than 120 mg/dl are having an abnormal ecg. 

# How many people with resting blood pressure of more than 130 are having an abnormal ecg ? 

SELECT distinct * 
FROM bit_db.heart 
WHERE  trtbps > "130" AND restecg = "1" 
OR restecg = "2" 

> 64 people only are experiencing high systolic blood pressure and showing abnormal ECG .
