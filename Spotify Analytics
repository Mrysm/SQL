# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1-What are the 10 most popular tracks in the database?

SELECT artist_name, track_name,popularity
from bit_db.Spotifydata
order by popularity desc
limit 10

#2-what are the 5 songs with highest liveness score?

SELECT artist_name, track_name,liveness
from bit_db.Spotifydata
order by liveness desc
limit 5

#3-what songs have a popularity less than 85%
#4-what are 10 the more dancable tracks?
#5-what is the average lenght of tracks?
#6-which artist has more songs?

6-
