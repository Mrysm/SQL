# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.

The data is about 50 most listened songs in the world for year 2021 in Spotify. 
This dataset has 14 descriptive variables about the songs.

# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1-What are the 10 most popular tracks in the database?

SELECT artist_name, track_name,popularity
from bit_db.Spotifydata
order by popularity desc
limit 10

#2-what are the 5 songs with highest liveness score?

SELECT artist_name, track_name,liveness
from bit_db.Spotifydata
order by liveness desc
limit 5

#3-what songs have a popularity less than 85%?

SELECT artist_name, track_name,popularity
from bit_db.Spotifydata
where popularity < '85'
order by popularity asc

#4-what are 10 the more dancable tracks and popularity more than 90?

SELECT artist_name, track_name,popularity,danceability
from bit_db.Spotifydata
where popularity > '90'
order by danceability DESC
limit 10

#5-what is the average lengTH of tracks?

SELECT avg (duration_ms)
from bit_db.Spotifydata

#6-which artists has more songs in the listing of top 50 in Spotify?

SELECT artist_name, count(track_name)
from bit_db.Spotifydata
group by artist_name
order by count(track_name) DESC
